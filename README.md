# spring-data-jpa
This repository is where I'm applying what I've learned from the Spring Data JPA course by Amigoscode. I'm using Spring Boot and JPA to practice working with databases, managing entity relationships, and writing efficient queries. Each update shows my progress, including examples of CRUD operations, pagination, and custom queries
